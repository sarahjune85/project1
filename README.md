# codeTears ðŸ’§

## Try not to cry. Cry a lot.

Record your small code victories - record the snippets that once brought you to tears.

## General Information

This project is a Ruby on Rails CRUD app created for General Assembly's software engineering immersive.

I've often found myself wishing I had a code snippet app that was less Evernote-ish - a little more casual for us coding newbies (no disrespect to the many great snippet apps out there).

My app allows you to add small code blocks in almost any language (at least - if highlight.js supports it) and will display the troublesome block for you with syntax highlighting.

It uses nested models to display language boards, their lists, and their list's snippets.
